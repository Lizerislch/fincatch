Stores the file of the FinCatch Coding Task

Both Task got their own README.md in the respective files to do the answering question and the report.

Both the medium and hard tasks stretched me a lot, and I truly appreciate the opportunity to attempt them.
I learned a great deal through trial and error during the process.

The code may look rough, thank you in advance for your patience—I’d be grateful for any feedback to help me improve further.

Thanks again for taking the time to review my work.
